# Free-Form Exploration

A free-form exploration implementation would allow the player to wander using directional keys. They will have the freedom to move in whatever direction the terrain allows.

## __Pros__

* Scale of the world is preserved, and remote destinations will take an appropriately long time to reach.

## __Cons__

* Potentially very boring, with a lot of "hold down directional keys" gameplay.
* 2D, lo-fi graphics do not "inspire" exploration the same way a beautiful 3D world does
* Overhead viewpoint makes it impossible to see far-off destinations -- player will basically be wandering blind

## Add Interest to Free-Form Exploration

The primary con of the free-form exploration method is that it is very boring to have extended periods of repeated "movement" actions with no real impact. We could counteract this by adding meaningful choices or content during overland traversal in one or more of the following:

* Adding one or more "minigames" for managing resources, hunger, stamina, etc.
* Adding one or more "exploration" minigames, allowing the player to find resources or secrest while travelling
* Adding content while travelling, such as dialog between party members
* Populate the game with meaningful time constraints, which give the player options to balance the route they select, traversal method, etc. against the impact of travelling faster or slower
* Add so much content and/or combat encounters that there is not much "empty" space to traverse
