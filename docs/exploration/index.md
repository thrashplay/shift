This document contains notes regarding how the exploration mechanics will work in Shift. It is a work-in-progress or scratchpad for ideation, and may not represent ideas that were implemented in any version of the project.

## High Level Approaches

* [Fog of War](./fog-of-war.md): Free form movement along a map that operates on a larger scale than the 5' grid
* [Free-Form](./free-form.md): Move along a giant tilemap using movement keys
* [Menu-Based](./menu-based.md): Move from point-to-point along pre-defined routes.
* [Hybrid](./hybrid.md): Use different systems for different types of movement and exploration
