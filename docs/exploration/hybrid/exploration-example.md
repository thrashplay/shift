# Example of Exploration Movement in Hybrid Model

1. Player selects their current or adjacent region on the map
2. Player selects "Begin Expedition" or similar button
3. Player selects an expedition goal: Explore, Gather \<RESOURCE>, Search for \<POINT_OF_INTEREST>, Hunt \<MONSTER_TYPE>, etc.

## Explore

1. Player just wants to "see what is there"
2. Provides the highest increase to knowledge of the hex
3. Random chance to encounter anything present in the hex

Note, this method of travel has currently been tabled in favor of "fog of war" exploration.
