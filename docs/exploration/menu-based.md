# Menu-Based Exploration

A menu-based exploration implementation would work by implementing the world map as a pointcrawl ([Example 1](http://hillcantons.blogspot.com/2012/01/crawling-without-hexes-pointcrawl.html)), and providing a list of all known paths to the player. Players would explore the world by traversings these paths and discovering new points of interest as they do so.

## __Pros__

* No "boring" moving around a map

## __Cons__

* No sense of scale -- world will feel very small due to ease of travel
* Easy to "brute force" all the exploration options
