# Sample Map Scale

Map hexes are 12mi. Each hex is 374.12 square miles.

Assuming full feudal demographics:
---
This means each hex would have 41.5 villages, if this were England. Villages have like no commerce, just residential farming. 50-100 ppl who never leave, ruled by knight or baron.
Each hex has roughly 3-4 towns which have commerce. Town population is ~3000 ppl. London was ~10,000.

Map depicts ~2 kingdoms of ~150,000 square miles.

We probably will have lower density and more ruins. Assume that farmland is less productive, population is declining, and much land remains fallow.
  -- maybe 'blighted animals' spread faster and farther, and the blighted plants and soil follows much slower
  -- this would explain why it is dangerous to farm many areas
